## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Start for Angular Developers

If you're coming from Angular/TypeScript, start here:

1. **[Angular to Flutter Mapping](development/angular-to-flutter.md)** - Understand the conceptual differences
2. **[Architecture Overview](architecture/overview.md)** - Learn Clean Architecture in Flutter
3. **[Domain Layer](architecture/domain.md)** - Start with business logic (most familiar)

## ðŸ”§ Development Workflow

1. **Observe** - Read relevant documentation and understand requirements
2. **Plan** - Design the feature following Clean Architecture principles
3. **Execute** - Implement with educational comments and Angular analogies
4. **Review** - Test and document the implementation

## ðŸ“– Educational Focus

Every file in this project includes:
- **Angular/TypeScript analogies** - Connect Flutter concepts to familiar patterns
- **Educational comments** - Explain the "why" behind architectural decisions
- **Business context** - Link technical implementation to user requirements

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. Review the [Business Requirements](../BUSINESS.md) for context
2. Study the [Architecture Guide](../ARCHITECTURE.md) for technical decisions
3. Follow the [Agent Playbook](../AGENTS.md) for development workflow
4. Start implementing features following the Clean Architecture layers
