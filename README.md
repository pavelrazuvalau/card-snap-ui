# Card Snap UI â€” AI-Assisted Flutter Learning Playground

Card Snap UI is a Flutter codebase engineered as a self-guided tutorial.  
Every module, test, and workflow is written to teach an Angular/TypeScript developer how a production-grade Flutter app is assembled, with AI copilots acting as patient mentors instead of raw automation.

> Guiding idea: **write so AI can teach it, and humans can learn it.**

## Why This Repo Exists

- translate familiar Angular patterns into idiomatic Dart/Flutter;
- document *why* architectural choices exist, not just *what* the code does;
- pair human curiosity with AI explanations so the project functions like a textbook.

Depth of understanding comes before delivery speed. Clarity, commentary, and reproducibility are the default success metrics.

## Where to Go Next

- **Architecture & detailed patterns:** `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Business requirements & SRS baseline:** `BUSINESS.md`
- **AI copilot operating rules:** `AGENTS.md`
- **Automation & infrastructure:** `infra/`
- **Narrative docs & guides:** `docs/`
- **Release process & changelog:** `ARCHITECTURE.md` Â§20, `CHANGELOG.md`

## Quick Start

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter test
flutter run
```

Use `flutter test integration_test` for end-to-end suites when changes cross layers. See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for architecture-specific testing guidance.

## Run on Specific Platforms

- **Android:**  
  1. Ensure an emulator or device is connected (`flutter devices`).  
  2. Run `flutter run -d <deviceId>` for debug builds.  
  3. For release builds, use `flutter build apk` or `flutter build appbundle` followed by the release workflow in `infra/`.

- **iOS (macOS required):**  
  1. Open Xcode once and accept licenses (`sudo xcodebuild -runFirstLaunch`).  
  2. Run `flutter run -d <iOS simulator/device>` for development; use `flutter build ipa` inside the release workflow for distribution.  
  3. Provisioning profiles and signing configs live in `infra/` to keep the process reproducible.

- **Web/Desktop (optional experiments):**  
  Enable the desired platform with `flutter config --enable-<platform>-desktop` or `--enable-web`, then run `flutter run -d chrome` or the relevant desktop device. Treat these builds as educational sandboxes unless explicitly promoted to release scope.

> The current environment may not have Flutter installed. Do not execute these commands until the toolchain is available; keep the instructions for future reference.

## Educational Comment Philosophy

| Type | Prefix | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| Documentation | `///` | Architectural intent captured by `dartdoc`/mkdocs. |
| Syntax Explanation | `//` | Dart language clarifications for developers who think in Angular. |
| Deep Insights | `// ðŸ§ ` | Runtime, async, and memory insights that invite deeper exploration. |

Comments are part of the architecture. Preserve and extend them when making changes.

## Collaborating with AI

Cursor, GitKraken MCP, and other copilots must follow the playbook in `AGENTS.md`. The playbook defines identity, guardrails, workflow, and communication style so every automated change remains faithful to the projectâ€™s teaching mission.
