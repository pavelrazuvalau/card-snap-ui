# Card Snap UI â€” AI-Assisted Flutter Learning Playground

**Card Snap UI** is a Flutter codebase for developing **Card Snap Wallet** â€” an offline-first loyalty and discount card manager for Android and iOS.  
The repository is engineered as a self-guided tutorial where every module, test, and workflow teaches an Angular/TypeScript developer how a production-grade Flutter app is assembled, with AI copilots acting as patient mentors instead of raw automation.

> Guiding idea: **write so AI can teach it, and humans can learn it.**

## Why This Repo Exists

This repository serves two primary purposes:

1. **Build Card Snap Wallet** â€” A production-ready, offline-first mobile application for managing loyalty and discount cards. All features must satisfy business requirements defined in `BUSINESS.md`.
2. **Educational Platform** â€” A comprehensive learning resource that:
   - translates familiar Angular patterns into idiomatic Dart/Flutter
   - documents *why* architectural choices exist, not just *what* the code does
   - pairs human curiosity with AI explanations so the project functions like a textbook
   - ensures business requirements guide all architectural decisions

Depth of understanding comes before delivery speed. Clarity, commentary, and reproducibility are the default success metrics. **All implementations must align with business requirements in `BUSINESS.md`.**

## Quick Start

### Web Development (Local Testing)
```bash
# Windows (CMD)
run_web.bat

# Windows (PowerShell)
.\run_app.ps1

# Linux/Mac  
./run_web.sh

# Manual - choose your browser
flutter run -d chrome     # Chrome (recommended)
flutter run -d edge       # Edge
flutter build web         # Build for Firefox, then open in browser
```

### Mobile Development (iOS/Android)
```bash
# Check setup
flutter doctor

# Run on connected device
flutter run -d <device-id>

# Build for production
flutter build apk --release    # Android
flutter build ios --release    # iOS
```

### Prerequisites
- **Flutter SDK** 3.9.2+
- **Android Studio** (for Android development)
- **Xcode** (for iOS development, macOS only)
- **Web Browsers** (for web development):
  - Chrome (recommended, hot reload support)
  - Edge (hot reload support)
  - Firefox (requires build step, no hot reload)

> **Note:** Flutter's web support currently provides hot reload for Chrome and Edge only. For Firefox, use `flutter build web` then open `build/web/index.html` in the browser.

### Verification & Testing

Before committing changes, verify the project:

```bash
# 1. Run linter (must pass with no errors or warnings)
flutter analyze

# 2. Run tests (all tests must pass)
flutter test

# 3. Run tests with coverage
flutter test --coverage

# 4. Format code
dart format .

# 5. Verify build (optional but recommended)
flutter build web
```

See `test/README.md` for detailed testing strategy and coverage requirements. Use `flutter test integration_test` for end-to-end suites when changes cross layers. See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for architecture-specific testing guidance.

### Code Quality Standards

AI agents must follow code quality requirements defined in `STYLEGUIDE.md`. **See `STYLEGUIDE.md` Â§3** for comprehensive code quality and linting requirements.

**Quick Reference:**
- Use `super.parameter` syntax for cleaner constructors
- Add `const` keyword for compile-time constants
- Avoid redundant default arguments
- Run `dart format .` and `flutter analyze` before committing
- Include `STYLEGUIDE.md` references in code comments (see `AGENTS.md` Â§6.3)

**Code Comments & Documentation:**
See `AGENTS.md` Â§6.3 for complete guidelines on adding `STYLEGUIDE.md` references in code comments, format specifications, and discovery workflow when encountering new patterns.

See `STYLEGUIDE.md` Â§3 for comprehensive guidelines and examples. See `AGENTS.md` Â§6.3 for comment and reference requirements.

## Run on Specific Platforms

- **Android:**  
  1. Ensure an emulator or device is connected (`flutter devices`).  
  2. Run `flutter run -d <deviceId>` for debug builds.  
  3. For release builds, use `flutter build apk` or `flutter build appbundle` followed by the release workflow in `infra/`.

- **iOS (macOS required):**  
  1. Open Xcode once and accept licenses (`sudo xcodebuild -runFirstLaunch`).  
  2. Run `flutter run -d <iOS simulator/device>` for development; use `flutter build ipa` inside the release workflow for distribution.  
  3. Provisioning profiles and signing configs live in `infra/` to keep the process reproducible.

- **Web/Desktop (optional experiments):**  
  Enable the desired platform with `flutter config --enable-<platform>-desktop` or `--enable-web`, then run `flutter run -d chrome` or the relevant desktop device. Treat these builds as educational sandboxes unless explicitly promoted to release scope.

> The current environment may not have Flutter installed. Do not execute these commands until the toolchain is available; keep the instructions for future reference.

## Key Architectural Patterns

Card Snap UI follows clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

- **Factory Pattern**: `AdaptiveWidgetFactory` creates platform-specific UI components (Material/Cupertino/Web) based on runtime detection
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts data access with `CardRepository` interface and concrete implementations
- **Use Cases Pattern**: Encapsulates business logic in dedicated use case classes
- **Dependency Injection**: Domain layer depends on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete implementations

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed pattern documentation.

## Educational Comment Philosophy

| Type | Prefix | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| Documentation | `///` | Architectural intent captured by `dartdoc`/mkdocs. |
| Syntax Explanation | `//` | Dart language clarifications for developers who think in Angular. |
| Deep Insights | `// ðŸ§ ` | Runtime, async, and memory insights that invite deeper exploration. |

Comments are part of the architecture. Preserve and extend them when making changes.

## Collaborating with AI

Cursor, GitKraken MCP, and other copilots must follow the playbook in `AGENTS.md`. The playbook defines identity, guardrails, workflow, and communication style so every automated change remains faithful to the project's teaching mission and business requirements.

**AI agents must:**
- Follow business requirements in `BUSINESS.md` by default
- Align architectural decisions with `ARCHITECTURE.md` patterns
- Follow code style standards in `STYLEGUIDE.md` for all code changes
- Add `STYLEGUIDE.md` references in code comments and update documentation per `AGENTS.md` Â§6.3
- Reference functional specifications and acceptance criteria from `BUSINESS.md` during implementation
- Ensure all features satisfy MUST/SHOULD/WON'T priorities defined in `BUSINESS.md` Â§2
