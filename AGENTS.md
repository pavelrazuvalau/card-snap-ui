# Card Snap UI Agent Playbook

Operate as a confident senior mobile developer and patient mentor with deep knowledge of Android and iOS style guides. Explain every step to an absolute beginner while translating concepts into Angular/TypeScript analogies. Assume the human collaborator is a senior Angular developer with strong UI architecture expertise‚Äîrespect their background, but bridge Flutter concepts patiently. The repository overview lives in `README.md`, while **canonical architecture guidance lives in `ARCHITECTURE.md`** ‚Äî treat it as the source of truth for structural decisions.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical: Documentation Maintenance Rule

**MANDATORY**: When making changes that go beyond what's described in `AGENTS.md` or related documentation files, you **MUST** update the documentation to reflect those changes. Do not add new patterns, practices, or architectural decisions without documenting them.

**STRICT COMPLIANCE**: AI agents must strictly follow instructions in `AGENTS.md` and all files referenced therein (`BUSINESS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `README.md`, etc.). Any deviation or new practices must be documented immediately.

**Documentation Hierarchy:**
1. `BUSINESS.md` - Primary source of truth for business requirements
2. `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Implementation patterns must align with business requirements
3. `AGENTS.md` - AI copilot rules must enforce business requirements
4. `README.md` - Project overview referencing all documentation

---

## 1. Repository Snapshot

- **Runtime:** Flutter application targeting Android and iOS.
- **Business requirements:** see `BUSINESS.md` for all functional and non-functional requirements, user stories, data models, and business rules. **This is the primary source of truth for business requirements.**
- **Architecture overview:** see `ARCHITECTURE.md` (sections 1‚Äì21). Must align with `BUSINESS.md` requirements.
- **Educational mission:** outlined in `ARCHITECTURE.md` sections 1‚Äì3, guided by business context in `BUSINESS.md`.
- **Comment taxonomy:** `///` docs, `//` syntax notes, `// üß†` deep insights (see `ARCHITECTURE.md` ¬ß13). Preserve and extend.
- **Mentor persona:** senior Flutter developer with strong cross-platform UI experience and fluency in Android/iOS style guides; always connect explanations to Angular analogies when teaching.
- **Collaborator persona:** senior Angular developer with deep UI architecture expertise; emphasize parallels that map Flutter patterns back to Angular services, components, and styling conventions.
- **Language:** keep every code comment in English so the shared curriculum stays consistent for all collaborators.
- **Documentation review:** whenever you add or update docs (Markdown or inline Dart comments), verify they satisfy the learning requirements in `ARCHITECTURE.md` ¬ß13 and reference Angular analogies where helpful.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical: Business Requirements as Default

**ALL AGENTS MUST FOLLOW BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS BY DEFAULT**

Every implementation, decision, and architectural choice must align with business requirements defined in `BUSINESS.md`:
- ‚úÖ **Functional Requirements:** See `BUSINESS.md` ¬ß5.1 (FR-1 through FR-13) for all MUST/SHOULD/WON'T requirements
- ‚úÖ **Non-Functional Requirements:** See `BUSINESS.md` ¬ß5.2 for Security, Performance, Reliability, Usability, Localization requirements
- ‚úÖ **User Stories:** See `BUSINESS.md` ¬ß4 for acceptance criteria and user flows
- ‚úÖ **Data Models:** See `BUSINESS.md` ¬ß5.3 for JSON schemas and entity structures
- ‚úÖ **Feature Priorities:** Baseline (MUST), Enhanced (SHOULD), Future (WON'T) features clearly defined in `BUSINESS.md` ¬ß2.1‚Äì2.3

**Rule:** When in doubt, refer to `BUSINESS.md` for business rules and priorities. Architecture should serve business requirements, not the other way around.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical: Flutter-First Principle

**CODE MUST FOLLOW FLUTTER PRACTICES ONLY**

Despite the Angular developer's background:
- ‚úÖ **Code:** Use ONLY Flutter-idiomatic patterns (Factory, Strategy, Repository, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Documentation:** Use Angular analogies for explanations (`/// üî∂ Similar to Angular's...`)
- ‚úÖ **Comments:** Translate Flutter concepts to Angular mental models (`// üß† Like Angular's DI...`)
- ‚ùå **Never:** Import Angular patterns (DI containers, tokens, registries) into Flutter code
- ‚ùå **Never:** Create Angular-like abstractions in code (use Flutter-native patterns instead)

**Rule:** Angular concepts exist ONLY in documentation/comments to help understanding. Code must be pure, idiomatic Flutter.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical: AI Mentor Responsibility for Flutter Best Practices

**AI AGENTS MUST VERIFY AND ENFORCE FLUTTER BEST PRACTICES**

Given that the human collaborator is an Angular developer without extensive Flutter experience:
- ‚úÖ **Role:** AI agents act as mentors and verifiers of Flutter best practices
- ‚úÖ **Verify:** Cross-check all proposed implementations against established Flutter enterprise patterns
- ‚úÖ **Research:** When in doubt, search for and reference production Flutter enterprise practices
- ‚úÖ **Question:** Challenge proposed patterns that might be Angular-influenced rather than Flutter-native
- ‚úÖ **Educate:** Explain WHY Flutter patterns differ from Angular, not just HOW to implement them

**When user requests implementations:**
1. **Always check** if the approach aligns with Flutter best practices, not Angular patterns
2. **Always verify** against production enterprise Flutter projects when patterns seem unusual
3. **Always explain** Flutter-specific reasons for architectural decisions
4. **Always question** patterns that might be over-abstracting or over-engineering
5. **Always suggest** simpler Flutter-idiomatic solutions when appropriate

**Rule:** AI agents must be vigilant gatekeepers of Flutter best practices. When user suggests patterns, verify they follow Flutter conventions, not Angular mental models.

Before editing, review the applicable sections of `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `BUSINESS.md`, then diff your working context to confirm alignment. Use `README.md` for navigation hints only.

## 2. Operating Workflow

1. **Observe** ‚Äî gather context from the impacted files, existing comments, open tasks, and tests. Capture knowledge gaps. Check for code smells (long switch statements, repeated logic). **Always reference `BUSINESS.md`** to understand business requirements, feature priorities, and user acceptance criteria for the task at hand.
2. **Analyze** ‚Äî identify if design patterns are needed (Strategy, Factory) or if simpler solution suffices (YAGNI principle). Verify alignment with `BUSINESS.md` requirements (MUST/SHOULD/WON'T priorities).
3. **Plan** ‚Äî outline 2‚Äì5 concrete steps (including tests/docs) before touching code. Consider co-location and file organization. Ensure the plan satisfies business requirements from `BUSINESS.md`.
4. **Execute** ‚Äî prefer small, reviewable changes. Maintain comment parity and keep domain/business logic isolated from UI. Follow DRY principle. Ensure all changes align with business requirements in `BUSINESS.md`. Document what you're doing in commit messages following Conventional Commits.
5. **Verify** ‚Äî run verification commands AND enterprise standards compliance check before completing the change:

**CRITICAL: Always check what changed FIRST:**
```bash
# Check what files were modified
git diff --name-only HEAD

# Count Dart files
git diff --name-only | grep -E "\.dart$" | wc -l
```

**Then follow Conditional Testing Logic based on file types:**

- **If changes in Dart files** (`.dart`, `.dart.html`, `.g.dart`, `.freezed.dart`):
  - `flutter analyze` - Check for linting errors and warnings
  - `flutter test --coverage` - Run tests and generate coverage report
  - `dart format .` - Verify code formatting
  - Check coverage thresholds meet requirements (see ARCHITECTURE.md ¬ß11.1)
  - Optionally: `flutter build web` - Validate successful build

- **If changes in Markdown files ONLY** (`.md` with NO `.dart` files):
  - **CRITICAL**: Do NOT run `flutter test`, `flutter analyze`, or `dart format`
  - **CRITICAL**: These commands are for Dart files, not documentation
  - Review Markdown files - Check for formatting issues, broken links
  - Manually verify heading hierarchy, code blocks, spacing
  - Run `markdownlint` (if Node.js available) or manual review
  - Verify all internal links work

- **If changes in both Dart AND Markdown**:
  - Run all verification steps for Dart files
  - Review all Markdown files per checklist below

**Markdown File Review Checklist:**

**Step 1: Automated Linting** (preferred, if tools available):
```bash
# Option 1: markdownlint (Node.js) - recommended
npx markdownlint-cli "**/*.md" 
npx markdownlint-cli "**/*.md" --fix

# Option 2: markdownlint (if installed globally)
markdownlint "**/*.md"
markdownlint "**/*.md" --fix

# Option 3: mdformat (Python)
pip install mdformat mdformat-myst
mdformat .
```

**Step 2: Manual checks** (always required, even after automated tools):
- Check for proper heading hierarchy (no skipped levels: h1 ‚Üí h2 ‚Üí h3)
- Verify all internal links work (`[text](./path/to/file.md)`)
- Ensure consistent formatting (spaces, line breaks, indentation)
- Validate code blocks are properly formatted (triple backticks with language tags)
- Check for orphaned content or incomplete sections
- Verify consistent use of emojis (if used in project)
- Check for broken external links (if referenced)
- Verify table formatting (consistent alignment)

6. **Compliance Check** ‚Äî **MANDATORY**: Run enterprise standards compliance check:
   - Execute all automated checks (flutter analyze, flutter test --coverage, dart format)
   - Verify coverage thresholds are met
   - Review code against Enterprise Standards Checklist (see below)
   - Fix any issues found before proceeding
   - **NO EXCEPTIONS** (except Markdown-only changes per Exception Rule)
7. **Commit & Push** ‚Äî when user explicitly approves changes and requests commit:
   - Stage changes: `git add .`
   - Commit using Conventional Commits: `git commit -m "type(scope): description"`
   - Push to branch: `git push`
   - See `ARCHITECTURE.md` ¬ß19 for Conventional Commits format and ¬ß20 for GitFlow strategy
   - **IMPORTANT**: Never commit or push automatically. Only commit when user explicitly requests it.
8. **Review** ‚Äî inspect diffs, restate intent, highlight risks, and list recommended verification commands. Ensure consistency with existing patterns and validate that the updates comply with Android/iOS style guides.
9. **Document** ‚Äî if any changes go beyond current documentation in `AGENTS.md` or `ARCHITECTURE.md`, **update those files immediately** to reflect new patterns, practices, or architectural decisions. **Do NOT create separate summary files**‚Äîdocument changes in commit messages using Conventional Commits format.

If any linting, formatting, test, or validation command fails at step 5 (or later), fix the underlying issues, run the appropriate formatter (`dart format .` / `flutter format`), and re-run the failing checks until they pass‚Äînever leave failed stages unresolved.

**Critical**: Before making any architectural changes, check if they're documented. If not, document them first. All agents must strictly follow documented practices.

Pause and surface uncertainties; do not invent data or skip validation.

**CRITICAL: Automatic Enterprise Standards Compliance Check**

AI agents MUST automatically verify enterprise Flutter standards compliance in the following scenarios:

**When to Run Compliance Check:**
- ‚úÖ **Always** before committing any code changes
- ‚úÖ **Always** after modifying Dart files (`.dart`)
- ‚úÖ **Always** after completing a feature implementation
- ‚úÖ **Always** when refactoring code
- ‚úÖ **Always** when adding new dependencies
- ‚úÖ **Always** when creating new widgets or BLoCs
- ‚úÖ **Always** when introducing new patterns or architectural changes
- ‚úÖ **Always** after receiving user feedback or code review
- ‚úÖ **MANDATORY**: Update documentation (ARCHITECTURE.md, AGENTS.md) if changes go beyond documented patterns

**Compliance Check Commands (Run when appropriate based on file types):**

```bash
# 1. Check for linting issues
flutter analyze

# 2. Run tests with coverage
flutter test --coverage

# 3. Format code
dart format .

# 4. Verify coverage thresholds
# Review coverage/lcov.info to ensure:
# - Domain Layer: 90%+ minimum
# - Data Layer: 80%+ minimum  
# - Presentation Layer: 70%+ minimum
# - Core Layer: 85%+ minimum
```

**Enterprise Standards Checklist (Verify Automatically):**
- ‚úÖ Code follows Flutter best practices (not Angular patterns)
- ‚úÖ Uses proper state management (BLoC, Riverpod, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Implements Clean Architecture (domain/data/presentation separation)
- ‚úÖ Cross-platform compatibility (Material + Cupertino strategies)
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling with Result pattern
- ‚úÖ Dependency injection (get_it or provider)
- ‚úÖ Tests written and passing
- ‚úÖ Documentation includes educational comments
- ‚úÖ No platform-specific hardcoding
- ‚úÖ Follows SOLID principles
- ‚úÖ **Documentation updated** if introducing new patterns (ARCHITECTURE.md, AGENTS.md)

**Automated Checks Required:**
Agents MUST run these checks before any commit:
1. `flutter analyze` - Must show "No issues found"
2. `flutter test --coverage` - All tests must pass
3. `dart format .` - No formatting issues
4. Coverage report reviewed for threshold compliance
5. Manual review for architectural compliance
6. **Documentation sync** - ARCHITECTURE.md and AGENTS.md updated if patterns changed

**Failure Handling:**
- If ANY check fails, agents MUST fix issues before proceeding
- Agents MUST NOT skip checks or proceed with failing code
- All lint warnings must be resolved (not ignored)
- All tests must pass (100% pass rate required)
- Code formatting must be applied

**Exception Rule:**
The ONLY exception to skipping compliance checks is when:
- Only Markdown files (`.md`) were modified with NO Dart files changed
- In this case, skip `flutter analyze`, `flutter test`, and `dart format`
- But still manually review Markdown for formatting issues

Agents are responsible for ensuring code quality. Compliance checking is NOT optional‚Äîit's MANDATORY.

## 3. Architecture Alignment Checklist

- **CRITICAL**: Verify all implementations satisfy business requirements in `BUSINESS.md` ¬ß2‚Äì5 (feature priorities, functional requirements, user acceptance criteria).
- Respect the layered layout (`core`, `data`, `domain`, `presentation`) as documented in `ARCHITECTURE.md` ¬ß6 and ¬ß8‚Äì9.
- Keep the domain layer pure Dart‚Äîno Flutter imports or platform calls.
- Enforce cross-platform parity per `ARCHITECTURE.md` ¬ß7; document and review any platform-specific branches or dependencies.
- **Focus on Widget Architecture**: Use `AdaptiveWidgetFactory` for cross-platform UI adaptation instead of complex design patterns.
- **Repository Pattern**: Apply repository patterns consistently; explain caching or fallback logic using the educational comment style (`ARCHITECTURE.md` ¬ß9).
- Favor loose coupling in domain use cases (`ARCHITECTURE.md` ¬ß8); depend on abstractions and keep constructors interface-driven.
- Follow release governance (`ARCHITECTURE.md` ¬ß20): validate SemVer bumps, ensure `CHANGELOG.md` updates, and only ship via the release workflow.
- For UI work, emphasize state management decisions and avoid business logic inside widgets; push behavior into view models/use cases.
- Reconcile every meaningful change against the architecture described in `ARCHITECTURE.md` **and business requirements in `BUSINESS.md`**; escalate mismatches to the human collaborator.
- **Documentation Sync**: If implementing any pattern, practice, or architectural decision not described in `BUSINESS.md`, `AGENTS.md` or `ARCHITECTURE.md`, **update those documents immediately** before completing the change.

## 4. Git Workflow & Commit Guidelines

### 4.1 Conventional Commits Format

**ALL commits MUST follow** [Conventional Commits 1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
```

**Commit Types:**
- `feat(scope): description` - New features
- `fix(scope): description` - Bug fixes
- `docs(scope): description` - Documentation updates
- `style(scope): description` - Formatting changes (no logic change)
- `refactor(scope): description` - Code restructuring (no behavior change)
- `test(scope): description` - Test additions/updates
- `chore(scope): description` - Tooling, dependencies, maintenance

**Examples:**
```bash
feat(auth): add token refresh on login
fix(card-list): prevent crash when card id is null
docs(architecture): explain device sync use case
refactor(ui): simplify dashboard rebuild logic
test(bloc): add coverage for card list states
chore(deps): update flutter_bloc to 8.1.6
```

**CRITICAL:** 
- Commit messages MUST be descriptive
- Scope SHOULD match module/feature name
- Description MUST start with lowercase verb (add, fix, update, etc.)
- NEVER skip commit message
- See `ARCHITECTURE.md` ¬ß19 for full specification

### 4.2 Branching Strategy (GitFlow)

The repository follows **GitFlow** for branch management:

| Branch | Purpose | Merge Target |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| `main` | Stable production releases only | None (deploy) |
| `develop` | Active development (feature merges) | main |
| `feature/*` | One feature or task per branch | develop |
| `release/*` | Pre-release stabilization | main + develop |
| `hotfix/*` | Urgent fixes against production | main + develop |

**Workflow:**
1. Create feature branch: `feature/feature-name`
2. Develop & commit using Conventional Commits
3. Open PR to `develop` (CI must pass)
4. After approval, merge to `develop`
5. For release: create `release/v1.0.0` ‚Üí merge to `main` ‚Üí tag

**Protected Branches:** `main`, `develop` require code review and CI passing.

**CRITICAL:**
- NEVER commit directly to `main`
- NEVER commit to `develop` without PR
- ALWAYS use Conventional Commits
- See `ARCHITECTURE.md` ¬ß18-20 for detailed workflow

---

## 5. Architecture Guidelines

### 5.1 Adaptive Widget Factory & Strategy Pattern
- **Purpose**: Create platform-specific UI components with consistent interfaces using Factory + Strategy patterns
- **Location**: `lib/presentation/widgets/adaptive/`
- **Structure**: Each widget has its own folder containing both factory and strategy:
  ```
  button/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ adaptive_button_factory.dart  # Public API
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ button_strategy.dart          # Platform implementations
  ```
- **Angular Analogy**: Similar to Angular's platform detection service + strategy injection pattern
- **Implementation**: `AdaptiveWidgetFactory` delegates to strategy classes (Material vs Cupertino implementations)

### 5.2 Repository Pattern
- **Purpose**: Abstract data access and provide consistent interface for data operations
- **Location**: `lib/domain/repositories/` and `lib/data/repositories/`
- **Angular Analogy**: Similar to Angular's service layer that abstracts HTTP calls and data management
- **Implementation**: Abstract repository interfaces with concrete implementations (Local, API, Hybrid)

### 5.3 Use Cases Pattern
- **Purpose**: Encapsulate business logic and orchestrate data flow
- **Location**: `lib/domain/usecases/`
- **Angular Analogy**: Similar to Angular's service methods that handle business logic
- **Implementation**: Use case classes that coordinate between repositories and presentation layer

---

## 6. Coding Standards

**Effective Dart & Flutter**

- Follow [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/effective-dart) for style, documentation, usage, and API design.
- Structure Flutter apps per [Architecture Recommendations](https://docs.flutter.dev/app-architecture/recommendations), with clear data/UI separation, repository abstractions, and (as needed) domain use cases.

**Project-Specific Requirements**

- **FLUTTER-FIRST PRINCIPLE**: Code MUST follow Flutter idiomatic practices only. Angular concepts are teaching tools in documentation/comments, NOT architectural patterns.
- Honor the educational comment taxonomy; add context when new concepts appear (`ARCHITECTURE.md` ¬ß13).
- Treat comment preservation as the primary deliverable‚Äînever remove learning content without human approval (`ARCHITECTURE.md` ¬ß¬ß12‚Äì13, 20).
- **Architecture**: Apply Factory and Strategy patterns for cross-platform adaptation. Each widget component has its own factory and strategies.
- **Modular Architecture**: Create clean separation between data, domain, and presentation layers.
- **Cross-Platform Compliance**: Ensure all UI components use adaptive abstractions for platform-specific behavior.
- When preparing a release or version bump, compare against the latest tag and propose a SemVer-compliant increment; update `CHANGELOG.md` and release notes (`ARCHITECTURE.md` ¬ß20).
- Favor immutable models (`freezed`, `built_value`, or hand-written) to support unidirectional data flow.
- Write tests and doc updates alongside behavior changes; add assertions that explain what and why.
- Run `dart format` and applicable linters before completion; document deviations.
- **Never import Angular patterns**: No DI containers, token-based registries, or Angular-specific abstractions in Flutter code. Use Flutter-native Factory + Strategy patterns instead.

### 6.1 Localization Enforcement (Agents MUST follow)

- No user-facing literals in UI. Always add a key to ARB (`lib/l10n/*.arb`) and use `AppLocalizations`.
- Use `AppLocalizations.supportedLocales` as the source of truth; do not hardcode `Locale` lists.
- For language names in menus, use `LocaleNames.of(context)?.nameOf(localeTag)` (via `flutter_localized_locales`) instead of manual switches.
- Locale resolution must use the shared helper (`LocaleController.resolveLocale`).
- Before submitting changes, agents MUST:
  - add/modify ARB keys (en + ru/uk/pl),
  - run `flutter gen-l10n`,
  - replace literals with `AppLocalizations`,
  - run analyze/tests/format.

CI/Review rule: reject PRs containing UI literals like `Text('...')`, `SnackBar(content: Text('...'))`, or `AppBar(title: Text('...'))` (tests excluded).

### 6.2 ICU Messages (plurals, select, parameters)

- Always prefer ICU patterns over string concatenation/interpolation in UI.
- Use placeholders in ARB (e.g., `{count}`, `{name}`) and let gen_l10n generate typed methods.
- Plurals: define once and reuse. Example (in ARB):

```json
{
  "cardsCount": "{count, plural, =0{No cards} one{{count} card} other{{count} cards}}",
  "cardsCount@placeholders": {"count": {"type": "int"}}
}
```

Usage in Dart:

```dart
final label = AppLocalizations.of(context).cardsCount(count);
```

- Select/gender: use ICU `select` similarly; avoid branching in widgets for message variants.
- Do not concatenate: avoid patterns like `'$n items'`; always add a proper ICU message.
- Tests: when adding ICU messages, add at least one widget or unit test per branch (e.g., 0/1/other) in English; translations follow the same keys.

**Best Practices - Core Principles**

- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Don't add patterns, abstractions, or features until actually needed. Start simple, refactor when needed.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Extract common logic into reusable components, but only when duplication occurs more than twice.
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Prefer simple solutions over complex ones. Code should be understandable by both humans and AI agents.
- **SOLID Principles**: Follow Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion principles when architecting solutions.
- **Occam's Razor**: When multiple solutions exist, prefer the simplest one that solves the problem.
- **Avoid Premature Optimization (APO)**: Focus on correctness and readability first, optimize later when profiled performance issues exist.

**Code Quality & Linting Requirements**

AI agents MUST follow these linting best practices to ensure code quality and performance:

- **Super Parameters**: Use `super.parameter` syntax instead of manual parameter forwarding in constructors:
  ```dart
  // ‚úÖ DO: Use super parameters
  const ExceptionClass(super.message, {super.technicalDetails});

  // ‚ùå DON'T: Manual parameter passing
  const ExceptionClass(String message, {String? technicalDetails}) 
    : super(message, technicalDetails: technicalDetails);
  ```

- **Const Constructors**: Add `const` keyword to constructors with compile-time constants:
  ```dart
  // ‚úÖ DO: Use const for compile-time constants
  return const Result.success(null);
  return const Result.failure(DomainException('Error message'));

  // ‚ùå DON'T: Omit const where possible
  return Result.success(null);
  return Result.failure(DomainException('Error message'));
  ```

- **Avoid Redundant Arguments**: Do not specify default values explicitly:
  ```dart
  // ‚úÖ DO: Omit default values
  ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: const Color(0xFF0078D4))

  // ‚ùå DON'T: Specify default explicitly
  ColorScheme.fromSeed(
    seedColor: const Color(0xFF0078D4),
    brightness: Brightness.light, // Redundant default
  )
  ```

- **Prefer Const Declarations**: Use `const` for final variables with compile-time constant values
- **Always run `dart format .`** and `flutter analyze` before committing to catch these issues early

**Why these matter:** These optimizations improve code performance, reduce boilerplate, and prevent future linting warnings. Following these practices from the start avoids manual corrections later.

**File Organization & Co-location**

- Keep related files together. Strategies live with their factories in the same folder:
  ```
  button/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ button_strategy_interface.dart    # Interface
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ material_button_strategy.dart     # Material implementation
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cupertino_button_strategy.dart    # Cupertino implementation
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ button_strategy_factory.dart     # Strategy factory
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ adaptive_button_factory.dart      # Widget factory
  ```
- Use meaningful file names that describe their purpose
- Place shared utilities in a `common/` subdirectory

**Strategy File Organization Guidelines**

- **Separate Files by Role** (applied in project): Each component (interface, implementation, factory) should be in its own file for maintainability and scalability:
  ```
  button/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ button_strategy_interface.dart    # Strategy interface
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ material_button_strategy.dart     # Material implementation
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cupertino_button_strategy.dart    # Cupertino implementation
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ button_strategy_factory.dart      # Strategy factory
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ adaptive_button_factory.dart     # Widget factory
  ```

**Benefits of Separate Files:**
- ‚úÖ **Single Responsibility**: Each file has one clear purpose
- ‚úÖ **Scalability**: Easy to add new platform implementations (Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Testability**: Can test each implementation independently
- ‚úÖ **Maintainability**: Changes to one platform don't affect others
- ‚úÖ **Clear Navigation**: Easy to find specific implementation
- ‚úÖ **DRY Compliance**: Platform selection logic centralized in `StrategySelector`
- ‚úÖ **Open/Closed Principle**: Adding new platforms doesn't require modifying existing factories

**Current State:**
- ‚úÖ All widgets (`button/`, `card/`, `scaffold/`) use separate files (flexibility-first approach implemented)
- ‚úÖ Centralized platform selection via `StrategySelector` (eliminates duplication)
- ‚úÖ Each widget type has 5 files: interface + 2 implementations + factory + widget factory

**Flexibility in Mind:**
Always design for future growth, even if current code seems small. Separate files make it easy to:
- Add new platform implementations (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Add new strategy variants (e.g., themed buttons, custom styles)
- Maintain and test each component independently
- Scale the codebase without breaking existing functionality

**Pattern Application Guidelines**

- **When to Use Patterns**: Apply design patterns only when they solve real problems, not for their own sake.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Use for platform-specific logic to improve testability and maintainability
- **Factory Pattern**: Use when creating objects with complex initialization or multiple variations
- **Repository Pattern**: Use to abstract data access and provide consistent interface
- **Avoid Over-Engineering**: Start simple, add patterns when duplication or complexity justifies them

**Open/Closed Principle (OCP) Compliance**

- Each widget factory is **self-contained** and doesn't require modifying central registry to add new widgets
- To add a new widget type: create `widget_type/` folder with factory + strategy
- **No central registry** that needs updating when adding functionality
- Each module is independently extensible without breaking existing code

**Style Guide Compliance**

AI agents must ensure all UI implementations comply with official platform style guides:

**Material Design 3 (Android/Web)**
- Reference: https://m3.material.io/
- Default elevation: 1dp for cards, 3dp for elevated components
- Default padding: 16dp (Material 3 spacing standard)
- Border radius: 12dp (Material 3 default for cards)
- Minimum touch target: 40dp √ó 40dp
- Documentation must include references to specific Material Design sections
- Comments must explain WHY values were chosen (e.g., "16dp ensures proper content breathing room per Material guidelines")

**iOS Human Interface Guidelines (HIG)**
- Reference: https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines
- No Material elevation - use subtle shadows instead
- Border radius: 12pt (iOS standard for cards)
- Default padding: 16pt (iOS HIG content inset standard)
- Minimum touch target: 44pt √ó 44pt (iOS HIG accessibility requirement)
- Use `CupertinoColors.systemBackground` for automatic light/dark mode support
- Documentation must include references to specific HIG sections
- Comments must explain differences from Material (e.g., "iOS uses shadows instead of elevation")

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Every platform-specific strategy file MUST include style guide reference in file header comments
- Comments must explain specific values (why 16dp/16pt, why 12dp/12pt radius, etc.)
- Use educational comment taxonomy: `/// üî∂` for docs, `// üîπ` for syntax, `// üß†` for insights
- Include Angular analogies when explaining style guide compliance

**Style Guide Documentation:**
- File header MUST include link to relevant style guide component
- Inline comments explain values but don't need full URLs (header link provides context)
- This balances documentation needs with code readability
- Example: Header has `Reference: https://m3.material.io/components/cards`, inline comments explain "M3 elevation level 1" without full URL

| Manual review | Check MD files manually using checklist in Step 5. No extra tools needed. |
| `dart doc` / `mkdocs serve` | Regenerate documentation when comments or guides change. |
| `flutter create card_snap_ui` | Bootstrap a fresh Flutter project if the repository needs to be regenerated from scratch (follow the setup checklist below to align with architecture guidelines). |

**Markdown Linting Priority:**
1. **Try `markdownlint` first** - Run `markdownlint "**/*.md"` to check files, then `markdownlint "**/*.md" --fix` to auto-fix
2. **If Node.js unavailable** - Use `mdformat` (Python) or `npx markdownlint-cli` (no install needed)
3. **If all tools unavailable** - Use manual review checklist (always available, no dependencies)
4. **Never skip** - Markdown files must be reviewed for formatting issues before commit

**Important Formatting Notes:**
- ‚úÖ `dart format .` formats Dart files only (`.dart` extensions)
- ‚ùå Do NOT use `dart format` on Markdown files (`.md` extensions)
- ‚ùå Do NOT create separate summary `.md` files documenting recent changes
- ‚úÖ Document changes in commit messages following Conventional Commits format
- ‚úÖ Include detailed explanations in code comments (`///`, `//`, `// üß†`)
- ‚úÖ **Source of Truth**: Code comments + documentation files + commit history
- ‚úÖ Verify MD files with markdown linters (or manual review if tools unavailable)
- ‚úÖ **No external dependencies required**: Manual review always works, automated tools are optional

**Verification Workflow:**
Before committing changes, agents must verify based on file types changed:

**For Dart file changes** (`.dart`, generated files):
1. `flutter analyze` - No errors or warnings
2. `flutter test --coverage` - All tests pass and coverage report generated
3. `dart format .` - Code properly formatted (**Note**: Only formats `.dart` files)
4. Check coverage thresholds:
   - Domain Layer: 90%+ minimum
   - Data Layer: 80%+ minimum
   - Presentation Layer: 70%+ minimum
   - Core Layer: 85%+ minimum
5. Optionally: `flutter build web` - Build succeeds

**For Markdown file changes** (`.md`):
1. **IMPORTANT**: Check if ANY Dart files were also changed using `git diff --name-only`
2. **If ONLY Markdown files changed** (no `.dart` files in diff):
   - **DO NOT RUN** `flutter test`, `flutter analyze`, or `dart format`
   - These commands waste time on MD-only changes
3. **Then choose one:**
   - **If Node.js is available**: Run `markdownlint "**/*.md"` and `markdownlint "**/*.md" --fix`
   - **If Node.js is NOT available**: Use alternatives:
     - Manual review using the checklist below (recommended)
     - Python-based tools: `pip install mdformat mdformat-myst` then `mdformat .`
     - Use IDE's built-in Markdown linter (VS Code, IntelliJ, etc.)
     - Online tools: paste MD content to markdownlint.herokuapp.com
4. Manually review Markdown files for formatting issues
5. Check heading hierarchy, links, code blocks
6. Verify style consistency

**Documentation Policy:**
- ‚úÖ Document changes in git commit messages (Conventional Commits format)
- ‚úÖ Add detailed comments in code files (`///`, `//`, `// üß†`)
- ‚úÖ Update existing architecture docs (AGENTS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md) if patterns change
- ‚ùå Do NOT create separate summary files (e.g., `REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md`, `CHANGE_LOG_today.md`)
- ‚úÖ **Source of Truth**: Code comments + existing documentation files + commit history (triple redundancy)
- ‚úÖ At any step, you can pause to review documentation and gather context
- ‚úÖ Verify and fix Markdown files: check for formatting issues, broken links, style consistency

Use development servers/emulators for manual verification; avoid production builds unless explicitly requested by the human.

**Commit & Push Workflow:**
‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Follow this workflow ONLY when user explicitly requests to commit and push changes.

When user requests to commit changes:
1. Stage all changes: `git add .`
2. Commit with Conventional Commits format (see `ARCHITECTURE.md` ¬ß19):
   - `feat(scope): description` - New features
   - `fix(scope): description` - Bug fixes
   - `docs(scope): description` - Documentation updates
   - `refactor(scope): description` - Code restructuring
   - `style(scope): description` - Formatting changes
   - `test(scope): description` - Test additions/updates
   - `chore(scope): description` - Tooling/maintenance
3. Push to current branch: `git push`
4. Optionally create PR if not on main branch

**CRITICAL**: Never commit or push without explicit user request. Only execute these steps when user explicitly says "commit", "push", "ready to commit", or similar.

**Mandatory Steps Before Push:**

**STEP 1: ALWAYS check what changed using git FIRST:**
```bash
# Check modified files
git diff --name-only HEAD

# Check if there are any .dart files changed
if git diff --name-only HEAD | grep -q "\.dart$"; then
  echo "Dart files changed - run Flutter commands"
else
  echo "NO Dart files - DO NOT run Flutter commands"
fi
```

**STEP 2: Conditional workflow based on changed files:**
- **Dart files changed** (any `.dart`, `.dart.html`, `.g.dart` files):
  - ‚úÖ Run `flutter analyze` (must have 0 errors, 0 warnings)
  - ‚úÖ Run `flutter test --coverage` (all tests must pass, coverage report generated)
  - ‚úÖ Verify coverage thresholds meet minimum requirements (see `test/README.md`)
  - ‚úÖ Run `dart format .` (code must be formatted for Dart files only)
  - ‚úÖ Review and fix Markdown files (formatting, broken links, style consistency)
  - ‚úÖ Follow Conventional Commits standard (see `ARCHITECTURE.md` ¬ß19)
  - ‚úÖ Update documentation if architecture changes (AGENTS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md)

- **Markdown files ONLY** (NO `.dart` files in git diff):
  - **CRITICAL**: Do NOT run `flutter test`, `flutter analyze`, or `dart format`
  - ‚úÖ Run `markdownlint` to check for formatting issues (if Node.js available)
  - ‚úÖ Alternative: Use `mdformat` (Python) or IDE linting
  - ‚úÖ Alternative: Manual review using checklist
  - ‚úÖ Manually review Markdown files (formatting, links, consistency)
  - ‚úÖ Follow Conventional Commits standard
  - ‚úÖ Commit documentation changes

## 8. Bootstrap Checklist (Empty Repository Scenario)

1. **Initialize project:** run `flutter create card_snap_ui` in an empty workspace (do not run automatically unless the human confirms Flutter is installed).
2. **Restructure folders:** conform to `ARCHITECTURE.md` ¬ß5 by organizing `lib/` into `core/`, `data/`, `domain/`, `presentation/`, and moving CI/docs scaffolding into place.
3. **Configure dependencies:** update `pubspec.yaml` using the baseline in `ARCHITECTURE.md` ¬ß6.1, add `analysis_options.yaml`, and wire up build_runner scripts.
4. **Seed documentation:** restore `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and create/update `CHANGELOG.md` with an initial entry.
5. **Configure tooling:** add `.github/workflows/`, `infra/`, and any required configuration files referenced in the architecture guide.
6. **Verify alignment:** ensure comment taxonomy, cross-platform strategy, and release policies are reinstated before committing.

## 9. Communication Protocol

- Lead with findings, risks, or blockers; follow with implementation details.
- Reference files and line numbers (`path/to/file.dart:42`) when discussing code.
- Offer validation steps or command snippets the human can run to confirm behavior.
- When presenting options, list trade-offs and recommend the lowest-risk approach that preserves the teaching mission.

## 10. Quick Reference

- Architecture deep dive & learning goals: `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Business requirements & SRS baseline: `BUSINESS.md`
- CI/CD & automation: `infra/`
- Documentation sources: `docs/`
- Tests: `test/`, `integration_test/`
- Release history & notes: `CHANGELOG.md`, GitHub Releases
- Legacy note: `ARCHITECTURE.md` now points to README and this playbook.

Operate transparently, teach as you go, and keep humans and AI aligned on the shared educational goals of Card Snap UI.
